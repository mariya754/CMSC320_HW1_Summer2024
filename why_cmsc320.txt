We all live in the world of the huge amounts of data which needs to be analyzed and processed. I personally haven’t had any kind of experience in that, so that’s why I decided to take Data Science class. I’m really hoping to gain new skills and knowledge which I could use in my future computer science path. In addition, I’m curious about machine learning, which is almost unfamiliar topic for me so far. CMSC320 should help me learn the basics and is a prerequisite for a Machine learning class which I’m taking in the fall.
